Also, the feelings that tend to flood over you unexpectedly, which I can recall, like waking up on a Sunday and feeling a rush of comfort being all tucked up in your bed when its raining outside, mystical feelings that you get sometimes walking through nature, kind of feeling the “vibe” of a room or when you’re in a crowd, any of those things that can’t necessarily be classified as emotion, but seem to be more of a spiritual connection between mankind and reality.

      "Example 1: From the U.S.: I believe I am bi-polar. I don’t believe in talk therapy, but something is wrong with my head. I don’t know how else to describe this. I am an educator and have serious issues with the fact that I can not control my own brain. Can you tell me how a psychologist or psychiatrist could actually help me without just explaining their job? What kind of help could they give me besides medicine- which I have?\n",
      "Example 2: I have become rather troubled with my inability not to see my father as “contaminated”, for lack of a better term. I can’t prepare my meals when he is in the kitchen or drink beverages he stands near for fear he’s breathed near them. I can recall not being able to eat any food he even stood near from adolescence, which meant left-overs or seconds were a no. I can’t enter a room he’s been in without spraying an air freshener and I’ve not sat upon the couch for this very same reason. The thought of using the same utensils, regardless of how thoroughly it’s been washed, is absolutely revolting. If I know he’s used it, I cannot. I feel bad, as it must be heartbreaking for your own child to treat you like some sort of plague-victim, but I can’t help it. I have an extreme dislike of human smell, breath, saliva, and mouths in general-I can’t even watch scenes which incorporate close ups without feeling the need to not breathe or expel the air (exhale forcefully) contaminated by the screen-but it is at its extreme with him. I know it probably has something to do with our rather rocky relationship and the fact that, having grown up around him, I’m privy to his poor hygiene practices. As I’ve stated prior, I’ve felt this way from early adolescence, so perhaps these aspects aggravated an already-existent, admittedly irrational, hatred of the human mouth. I know he gets offended, as he should, but I can’t help it. What on earth should I do? Is there any way I can wean myself off of these irrational precautions without making myself overly uncomfortable? Thank you in advance.\n",
      "Example 1: My ss is 17. I’ve been in his life since age 6. He has always lied and been spiteful. Since I met his mom, he was constantly getting in trouble at school and barely made it thru each year. Now he has school online and only goes in a couple days a week and he’s getting all F’s. His mom has always had a hard time calling him out but I haven’t. The lying has never stopped. He just got better at it. He learned how to lie with sincerity.\n",
      "Example 2: I truly believe that I have high functioning autism. I have a lot of the symptoms, if not all of them. I have taken multiple online tests and they all say that I do have autism. The only problem is, is that my mother will not take me to get tested. I need a diagnosis, but I do not know how to get one without my mother. What do I do?\n",

      "Example 1: I have a sister that is in her thirties and I think she has a mental disorder. She is a paranoyed person. Things that to me is stupid she worries about. For example we were doing remodilng in our home and we were working on the bathroom and we took the bathroom door off and she came to my house and had to use the bathroom. It was just her and I there and she had to use the bathroom. She went through and shut all of my bedroom doors and checked to make sure that no one was in the house because she was afraid that someone would see her in the bathroom. She is also a depressed person and real hard to get along with. She has a daughter,her name begans with the same letter as mine and when we are all together she gets our name mixed up she calls her daughter by my name and just keeps doing it. My mom babied her and always has. All of my brothers and my one sister know she has a problem but we are not sure what it is. She drives all of us crazy,its hard to be around her. She is always asking my brother if he is mad at her because she thinks that he isn’t talking to her enough. She always wants pitty. She is a single mother and doesn’t work and expects her family to keep her. She has trouble taking orders at jobs because she gets mad. She got into trouble one time when she was in her twienties for hitting a co worker with a six pack of pop in the face. My brother told me when he was a little boy she used to bite the blood out of him and he would tell my mom and my sister would denie it every time and my mom would beleive her. My mom just doesnt relize she has a problem and I think she does. She told me that she went to the doctor last week and they told her that they thought she had bipolar. She doesn’t belive it. Im tired of my mom making excuses for her and defending her when she is wrong.\n",

      "Example 1: Hi. So I was diagnosed with Bipolar about 5 years ago. I haven’t been medicated in a while due to the fact I don’t have the funds to meet with a psychiatrist to get the correct prescription. I’ve been doing well without medication and I don’t believe I am experiencing a high or low mood, but I’ve started to notice something else that has become a major concern for me. For the past few weeks I’ve been hearing voices that aren’t my own. These voices do not speak to me, they sound more so like someone else talking behind my own thoughts. If I try to focus on the voices when they appear I can’t, they slowly fade away so I can’t really get an idea of what they say. These voices appear during the day and at night while laying down so they arent specific to a tired state. I have never experienced psychosis or hallucinations before and from my knowledge if hallucinations were to appear wouldn’t they be from depression or mania, not a pretty stable mood? Could there be another cause for these voices I’m hearing? I’ve been rather stressed recently due to college starting again but that is the only change in my routine/life recently. My main concern is that these voices aren’t a cause of my bipolar but a whole new illness (maybe schizophrenia) starting to present itself.\n",
      "Example 2: From Dubai: My mother died about 2 years ago but even before that I was always depressed as far as I can remember. But ever since she died I don’t feel like myself, right now I’m typing this messages but i feel like someone else is doing it for me,and I’m just in a tiny corner somewhere waiting for someone to help me get out.\n"
